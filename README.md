The Student Security Operations Center (SOC) Toolkit is designed to equip facilitators with everything needed to prepare high school and college students to actively contribute to a Security Operations Center at their school or institution. With structured learning modules, hands-on experience, and certification pathways, it provides the resources to implement a student SOC program. It includes step-by-step implementation guidance, a comprehensive skilling course, real-world cybersecurity scenarios, and built-in assessments—all aimed at helping students develop the skills necessary for success in the cybersecurity workforce while enhancing institutional security.

## Student SOC program foundations training

This 3-hour interactive training is designed to prepare  high school and higher education students with the hands-on experience and practical knowledge needed to actively contribute to a Security Operations Center (SOC) at their school or institution.

Over four 45-minute, self-paced lessons, participants will explore SOC functions, best practices, and tools like Microsoft Sentinel, Defender, and Security Copilot, gaining skills in incident response and threat detection. Learners will work through simulated security incidents, applying real-world practices to build problem-solving and decision-making abilities. By the end, students will have the foundation needed to take on a role in their institution’s SOC and pursue further training and certifications in the cybersecurity field.
